# Celestial Client

Lightweight client delivering unparalleled performance - optimised and finetuned to operate at the celestial speed of light.
Features and input lag perfected with German engineering. The only true competitor amongst them all.
Resource swapper and userscripts work the same as in BKC, so no inconvenience is caused by the need to adapt. The folder can be found in `Documents/celestial`.

*Exclusively compatible with Windows due to technical reasons. Everything is highly experimental, there may be some major instabilities or bugs.*

__*shoot freeze bug:__
Newer electron versions running at unlimited fps cause players to freeze when shooting. Celestial's revolutionary technology fixes this major flaw and enables true performance :)
